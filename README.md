This document outlines the workflow for contributing to the FOSS Club Website project.

### Workflow: How to Clone and Contribute:

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project, make your changes, and submit them for review.

### 1️⃣ Fork the Repository

To begin, create your own copy (fork) of this repository on GitHub.

* Navigate to the official repository: `https://github.com/BKM-05/FOSS-SELECTION-2025` 
* Click the `Fork` button (usually located in the top right corner of the GitHub page) to create a copy of the repository.

### 2️⃣ 2️⃣ Clone Your Fork to Your Local System

After forking, you need to download your personal fork to your computer so you can work on the files locally.

First, open your terminal or command prompt (you can use the VS Code terminal for this).

Clone your forked repository using the following command. Make sure to replace `BKM-05` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/BKM-05/FOSS-SELECTION-2025.git](https://github.com/BKM-05/FOSS-SELECTION-2025.git)

Now, navigate into the newly cloned project directory:

Bash
cd FOSS-Club-Website

3️⃣ 3️⃣ Make Your Changes
You are now ready to modify the project files. Open the FOSS-Club-Website directory in your preferred code editor and implement your desired changes.

4️⃣ 4️⃣ Add, Commit, and Push Your Changes
Once you have finished making your modifications, you need to save these changes to your local Git history and then upload them to your forked repository on GitHub.

Stage all your modified files for the next commit:

Bash
git add .

Commit your staged changes with a clear and concise message describing what you've done. (e.g., "feat: Add new event card for CodeCraft 2025" or "fix: Correct spacing on event cards"):

Bash
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"

Finally, push your committed changes from your local machine to your forked repository on GitHub:

Bash
git push origin main

(Note: If your default branch is named master instead of main, use git push origin master).

5️⃣ 5️⃣ Create a Pull Request
The last step is to propose your changes to be merged into the official FOSS Club Website repository.

Go to your forked repository on GitHub (e.g., https://github.com/BKM-05/FOSS-SELECTION-2025).
GitHub will typically show a prominent button or message indicating "Compare & pull request" or "New pull request" since you've just pushed changes. Click on it.
Carefully review the changes and fill out the Pull Request form. Provide a detailed description of your contribution.
Submit the Pull Request. The project maintainers will then review your changes.
Thank you for contributing to the FOSS Club Website!
